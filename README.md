# MNIST-digit-recognizer
This is my submission for kaggle competition of MNIST dataset <br>
View my kaggle submission [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshita2002/implementing-cnn-with-keras-99-089-accuracy)<br>
I achieved a final accuracy of `99.14%` in it <br>
Here, I've used a CNN model and implemented the same using Keras
# Convolutional Neural Network plot
This is the model plot for CNN that I've used <br>
